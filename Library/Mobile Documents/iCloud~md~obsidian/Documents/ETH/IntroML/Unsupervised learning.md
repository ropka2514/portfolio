## Unsupervised learning – goals & methods

#### Summary of some common goals, using characteristics of the data
- Anomaly detection of „unusual“ data points  
- Identification/discovery of (relevant) unobserved variables (such as features, classes)
- Compact representation / compression of data sets o Generation of new data
#### ML methods to learn characteristics of the data (covered in class):
- [[Clustering]] e.g. for learning similarity and anomaly of points  
- [[Dimensionality reduction]] e.g. for learning compact representations  
- [[Generative modeling]] (autoencoders, GANs etc.) e.g. for feature learning and data generation
